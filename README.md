###Scripts, data and outputs created by Madeline Berger 11/19 - 05/20
This repository contains all cleaning and wrangling done on field data (spatial and survey responses) collected as part of the Punjab Agricultural Burning project. Most up to date scripts can be found in the root folder of the repo. 

Below is a list and descriptions of the folders contained in this repo:
- `raw_spatial` contains the raw GIS coordinate data, shared in Nov 2019
- `raw_csv` contains any raw data with survey results from the field, including the baseline survey and monitoring and spotcheck activity. It also contains results from the calibration analysis run in ArcGIS, which was imported here to find summary statistics and visualize . See README document in this folder for futher details. 
- `int` is a folder for any intermediate exports that might be created
- `figs` contains any figure exports
- `outputs_mb` contains all the spatial datasets that where created in the `creating_polygons.Rmd`
- `old_scripts` contain scripts that are old and have newer versions, but are being kept in case there is helpful code in them
